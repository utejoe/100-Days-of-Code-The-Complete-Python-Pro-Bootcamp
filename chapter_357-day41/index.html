      William Blake was an English poet, painter, and printmaker. Largely
      unrecognised during his lifetime, Blake is now considered a seminal figure
      in the history of the poetry and visual arts of the Romantic Age.

      In 2002, Blake was placed at number 38 in the BBC's poll of the 100
      Greatest Britons.
